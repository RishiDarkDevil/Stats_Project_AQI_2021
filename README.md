# Air Quality Index of India 2021
As a Part of My First Year Spring Semester, Statistical Methods-II Project, I have chosen this topic to explore more about the condition of India's Air Quality Index & Pollutant Levels. \
In this Project my Primary Focus was to find out whether there was a Statistical Impact of COVID-19 related measures like suspension of Travel, Transportation, Industrial Work, etc. on the Levels of Pollutants Measured at various Cities. 
The Project is available as **Analysis_Report.md** and **Analysis_Report.pdf** to be viewed on Github itself. 
I have explored a lot and have learned more techniques on Data Visualization and Presentation. I even wrote big chunks of R-Codes for general purpose use not specific to this Project Only and have learnt a lot from them. 
Some of the Topics which I really enjoyed and learnt from this Project are:
- Fitting Models to Distributions.
- Simulation Based Inferential Statistics.
- Modelling Real World Data.
- Data Wrangling, Some nice ways to reshape and transform the Data.
Though there are few portions of my R-Codes which I wrote in-order to explore the Data, which had some important story to tell mainly because of the restriction on the length of the Project and partly because of some Time Constraints.
There are some genuine drawbacks which I didn't refered to in this project that is Multicollinearity, and few related issues.\
Mostly becausse I didn't have much knowledge and idea on them when I started with this Project. Though I will definitely return back with an updated more relevant dataset to respond and make important changes, once I know some more techniques to efficiently handle these issues along with some other interesting Modelling & Inferential Techniques.

I hope you Enjoy looking at my work.
