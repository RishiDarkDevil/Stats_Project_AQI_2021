# INTRODUCTION

In this Data Analysis Project, I am going to work with **Air Quality Index Data of India**. I will be using several Statistical Tools to Analyze the Data which includes Exploratory Data Analysis, Techniques and methodologies used for Inference and will be Modelling the Data to summarize any pattern or general trend.

I will also try to find out if there was any significant drop in the levels pollutant gases in the Atmosphere due to imposing lockdowns in the year 2020 and 2021, when several industries, factories, transportation facilities were suspended to work. I will be comparing the data for 2020 and 2021 with the previous years.
